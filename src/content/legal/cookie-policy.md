## Cookies on the Creodrop Platform

The Creodrop control panel (app.creodrop.com) uses only essential cookies required for authentication and session management. We do not use analytics or tracking cookies within the platform itself.

## Cookies on Customer Sites

Websites hosted on Creodrop may use their own cookies as configured by their owners. Creodrop does not control the cookie practices of sites hosted on our platform. Please refer to each site's individual cookie or privacy policy.
