Welcome to Creodrop. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Creodrop platform and services provided by JDDoesDev LLC ("Creodrop," "we," "us," or "our"), a company registered in Indiana, USA.

By creating an account or using our services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use Creodrop.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old to use Creodrop. By creating an account, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.

## 2. Account Registration

To use Creodrop, you must create an account with accurate and complete information. You are responsible for:

- Maintaining the security of your account credentials
- All activity that occurs under your account
- Notifying us immediately at support@creodrop.com if you suspect unauthorized access

You may create and manage multiple sites under a single account.

## 3. Services and Plans

Creodrop provides managed Drupal hosting services. Each site you create is governed by the plan you select for that site. Your selected plan determines your allocated storage, bandwidth, and computing resources.

You are responsible for ensuring your sites operate within the limits of your chosen plan. We reserve the right to suspend sites that consistently exceed their allocated resources until the issue is resolved or you upgrade to an appropriate plan.

## 4. Free Trial

We may offer a 7-day free trial for new sites. Trial sites:

- Cannot use custom domains
- May have limited features compared to paid plans
- Will be deleted at the end of the trial period unless you subscribe

We will notify you before your trial ends. If you do not subscribe, your trial site and its data will be permanently deleted.

## 5. Payments and Billing

### Payment Processing

All payments are processed by our third-party payment provider, LemonSqueezy. By subscribing to Creodrop, you also agree to LemonSqueezy's terms of service. We do not store your payment card information directly.

### Subscription Billing

Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually, depending on your selection). Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel before the end of the current billing period.

### No Refunds

All fees are non-refundable. This includes:

- Partial months or years of service
- Unused time after cancellation

### Price Changes

We may change our pricing at any time. For existing subscribers:

Price changes will apply at the start of your next billing cycle after the notice period.

We reserve the right to determine, in our sole discretion, whether content or activity violates these Terms.

## 7. Your Content and Responsibilities

### Ownership

You retain ownership of all content you create or upload to your Creodrop sites ("Your Content"). By using our service, you grant us a limited license to host, store, and display Your Content solely to provide the service to you.

## 8. Your Customers (Site Visitors)

When you use Creodrop to host a website that collects data from your visitors, you are the **data controller** for that data. Creodrop acts as a **data processor** on your behalf.

This means you are responsible for:

- Having a privacy policy on your site that complies with applicable laws
- Obtaining any necessary consents from your visitors
- Responding to data subject requests from your visitors
- Ensuring your data collection practices are lawful

If you require a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for compliance purposes, contact us at privacy@creodrop.com.

Creodrop may offer AI-powered features through a bring-your-own-key (BYOK) model. When using these features:

- You provide your own API keys for third-party AI services
- Communications between your site and AI providers pass through our infrastructure but are not stored by us
- You are responsible for complying with the terms of service of your chosen AI provider
- You are responsible for any costs incurred with your AI provider

## 10. Intellectual Property

Creodrop, including its design, features, documentation, and underlying technology, is owned by JDDoesDev LLC and protected by intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks, branding, or proprietary technology except as needed to use the service.

### Feedback

If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback about Creodrop, you grant us the right to use that feedback without restriction or compensation to you.

## 11. Third-Party Services

Creodrop integrates with third-party services including LemonSqueezy (payments), Linode (infrastructure), and Resend (email). Your use of these services through Creodrop is also subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.

We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or practices of third-party services.

## 12. Service Availability

**Our total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to these Terms or your use of Creodrop is limited to the fees you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.**

We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, business opportunities, or goodwill, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on certain damages. In those jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.

## 14. Indemnification

- Your use of Creodrop
- Your Content
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any third-party rights
- Any claims from visitors to your hosted sites

## 15. Termination

### By You

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to your sites until then unless you choose to delete them earlier.

## 16. Dispute Resolution

### Informal Resolution

Before initiating formal proceedings, you agree to contact us at support@creodrop.com and attempt to resolve any dispute informally for at least 30 days.

### Binding Arbitration

If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and Creodrop agree to resolve any claims through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that either party may bring claims in small claims court if eligible.

Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will take place in Indiana, USA, or remotely if both parties agree.

**Class Action Waiver:** You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis. You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

## 17. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## 18. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the Creodrop dashboard at least 30 days before the changes take effect.

Your continued use of Creodrop after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the service and close your account.

## 19. General Provisions

- **Entire Agreement:** These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Creodrop regarding your use of the service.
- **Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
- **Waiver:** Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to enforce it later.
- **Assignment:** You may not assign your rights under these Terms without our consent. We may assign our rights to any successor or affiliate.
- **No Agency:** Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Creodrop.
