Creodrop, a service of JDDoesDev LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our customers to do the same. This policy outlines how we respond to claims of copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

## Reporting Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content hosted on a Creodrop site infringes your copyright, please send a written notice to our designated DMCA agent containing the following information:

1. **Your contact information:** Full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

2. **Identification of the copyrighted work:** A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed. If multiple works are involved, provide a representative list.

3. **Identification of the infringing material:** The specific URL(s) or location of the material you claim is infringing, with enough detail for us to locate it.

4. **Statement of good faith:** A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

5. **Statement of accuracy:** A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

6. **Signature:** Your physical or electronic signature.

## Designated DMCA Agent

Please send all DMCA notices to:

**Email:** dmca@creodrop.com (preferred)

## How We Process Notices

Upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, we will:

1. Review the notice for completeness
2. Remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material
3. Notify the customer who posted the material that it has been removed
4. Provide the customer with a copy of the notice and information about filing a counter-notice

## Counter-Notification

If you are a Creodrop customer and believe your content was removed in error, you may file a counter-notice containing:

1. **Your contact information:** Full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

2. **Identification of removed material:** A description of the material that was removed and its location before removal.

3. **Statement under penalty of perjury:** A statement that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.

4. **Consent to jurisdiction:** A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or Indiana if you are outside the US) and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice or their agent.

5. **Signature:** Your physical or electronic signature.

Send counter-notices to dmca@creodrop.com.

## Restoration of Content

If we receive a valid counter-notice, we will forward it to the original complainant. If the complainant does not notify us within 10 business days that they have filed a court action seeking to restrain the allegedly infringing activity, we may restore the removed content.

## Repeat Infringers

We maintain a policy of terminating accounts of customers who are repeat infringers. We define a repeat infringer as any customer who has been the subject of two or more valid DMCA notices. We reserve the right to terminate accounts after a single notice in cases of egregious infringement.

## Misrepresentation Warning

Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material is infringing, or that material was removed by mistake, may be subject to liability. Please ensure that your DMCA notice or counter-notice is accurate before submitting.

## Not Legal Advice

This policy is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. If you are unsure whether material infringes your copyright or whether your content qualifies for fair use, please consult an attorney before submitting a notice.
