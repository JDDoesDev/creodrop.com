Creodrop is a service of JDDoesDev LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), a company registered in Indiana, USA. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use creodrop.com and the Creodrop platform.

## Who This Policy Applies To

This policy applies to **Creodrop customers**—people who create accounts and use our platform to build and host websites. If you're a visitor to a website hosted on Creodrop, the privacy policy of that website's owner applies to you, not this one.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account information:** Name, email address, and password when you register
- **Payment information:** Processed securely by our payment provider, LemonSqueezy. We do not store your credit card details directly.
- **Support communications:** Any messages you send to our support team

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Usage data:** We collect analytics about how you use the Creodrop control panel to improve our service and plan infrastructure scaling. This data is used internally and is never sold.
- **Marketing site analytics:** We use Google Analytics on our marketing website (creodrop.com) to understand how visitors find and interact with our site.
- **Server logs:** Standard technical logs that help us maintain security and diagnose issues

### Information We Do Not Collect

- **AI communications:** If you use AI features through your own API keys (BYOK), we do not store or access the content of those communications. They pass directly between your site and your chosen AI provider.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide and maintain your Creodrop account and hosted sites
- Process payments and manage your subscription
- Send transactional emails (account confirmation, password resets, billing notices)
- Improve our platform based on aggregated usage patterns
- Respond to support requests
- Comply with legal obligations

We do **not** sell your personal information to third parties.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- **Access** the personal data we hold about you
- **Correct** inaccurate information
- **Delete** your account and associated data
- **Export** your data in a portable format
- **Object** to certain processing activities
- **Withdraw consent** where processing is based on consent

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at privacy@creodrop.com.

### For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents

We process your data under the following legal bases as defined by the GDPR:

- **Contract performance:** To provide the services you signed up for
- **Legitimate interests:** To improve our services and maintain security
- **Legal compliance:** To meet our legal obligations
- **Consent:** Where you have explicitly agreed (e.g., marketing communications)

You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe we have violated your rights.

## Data Retention

- **Active accounts:** We retain your data for as long as your account is active.
- **Site deletion:** When you delete a site, it is immediately and permanently destroyed, including all associated data and storage volumes.
- **Subscription cancellation:** If you cancel your subscription without deleting your sites, they remain accessible until the end of your billing period, then are permanently deleted.
- **Account closure:** When you close your Creodrop account entirely, all your data is permanently deleted.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:

- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transmission
- Isolated container environments for each hosted site
- Regular security updates and monitoring
- Access controls limiting who can access customer data

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to privacy@creodrop.com.

## Your Customers' Data (For Site Owners)

When you use Creodrop to host a website, **you are the data controller** for any personal data collected from your site's visitors. Creodrop acts as a **data processor** on your behalf—we provide the infrastructure, but you determine what data to collect and how to use it.

This means:

- You are responsible for having your own privacy policy on your site
- You must comply with applicable privacy laws for your visitors
- You should only collect data you have a lawful basis to collect

If you need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for compliance purposes, contact us at privacy@creodrop.com.

## Age Requirement

Creodrop is not intended for anyone under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If we learn that we have collected data from someone under 18, we will delete it promptly.

## International Data Transfers

We are based in the United States. If you access Creodrop from outside the US, your data will be transferred to and processed in the US. By using our service, you consent to this transfer. We rely on standard contractual clauses and other appropriate safeguards for international data transfers where required.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by email or through the Creodrop dashboard. Your continued use of the service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
